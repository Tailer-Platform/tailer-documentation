# Transfer data with GBQ to Firestore

## :bulb: What is a gbq to Firestore configuration?

A gbq to firestore  data pipeline operation allows you to transform a dataset into Firestore documents for each row of the table.

## ‚úÖ **Overall operations needed**

**Caution : gbq-to-firestore is an advanced configuration which requires prior knowledge :**

* [Tables to storage configuration](../export-data-with-tables-to-storage/table-to-storage-configuration-file.md)
* [Vm-launcher configuration](../execute-code-processings-with-vm-launcher/process-code-with-vm-launcher/vm-launcher-code-processing-configuration-file.md)
* [Workflow configuration](../orchestrate-processings-with-workflow/workflow-configuration-file.md)
* Knowledge of python [(Data structures - Dictionaries)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html?highlight=dictionary#dictionaries)
* Knowledge of how [Firestore works](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

**When the Tables to Storage Tailer data operation is triggered** by an event (for example a Tables to Tables data operation success) or scheduled to start :

* The SQL query you specify will be executed to extract the relevant data from the source BigQuery table.
* The data will be exported to a JSON file located in the GCS bucket you specified.
* A VM with the specified characteristics is triggered on GCE.
* The instructions set in the JSON configuration file script\_to\_execute parameter are executed, and the script is launched.
* Once the execution is complete, the VM is stopped automatically
* Check the file tree in Firestore !
