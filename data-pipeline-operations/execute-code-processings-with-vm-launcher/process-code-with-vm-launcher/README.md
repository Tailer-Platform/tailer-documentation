# Process code with VM Launcher

## üí° What is the VM Launcher data operation for code processing?

The VM Launcher data operation allows you to start a Google Compute Engine VM where you can execute a script in the language of your choice, and then to stop the VM automatically to save resources.

## ‚úÖ Supported languages

All languages (Python, R, JavaScript, etc.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

Every time a script file appears in a given directory of a Google Cloud¬†Storage bucket:

* A VM with the specified characteristics is started on GCE.
* The instructions set in the JSON configuration file `script_to_execute` parameter are executed, and the script is launched.
* Once the execution is complete, the VM is stopped automatically.

## **üìã How to deploy a **VM Launcher** data operation for code processing**

1. Access your **tailer** folder (created during [installation](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MIIsP\_DvP2J-c1szWrQ/getting-started/install-tailer-sdk.md)).
2. Create a working folder as you want.
3. Create a JSON file for your data operation in your working folder. Refer to this page to learn about all the [parameters](../../xml-conversion/untitled-1.md).
4.  Access your working folder by running the following command:

    ```
    cd "[path to your working folder]"
    ```
5.  To deploy the data operation, run the following command:

    ```
    tailer deploy configuration your-configuration.json
    ```
6. Log in to [Tailer Studio](http://studio.tailer.ai) to check the status and details of your data operation.
7. For execute your VM Launcher data operation, place a script in the working folder.
