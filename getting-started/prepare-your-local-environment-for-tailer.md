# Prepare your local environment for Tailer

Tailer SDK runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Tailer SDK requires Python. Supported versions are 3.7 or higher.

Before installing Tailer SDK, a number of tasks need to be performed depending if you're planning to use a Windows or macOS/Linux environment.

## :computer: Windows

### **Install Python**

To install Python:

1. Access this page: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/
2. Select and download the installer for the release (3.7 or higher) that matches your operating system.
3. Launch the installer.
4. Select the **Customize installation** option, and make sure you check the **Add Python to environment variables** checkbox.
5.  To check if Python installation was successful, open a terminal, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

{% hint style="success" %}
The Python release number displays.
{% endhint %}

### **Create a working folder**

To create a working folder for Tailer SDK:

1.  Access the working folder of your choice:

    ```bash
    cd your_working_folder
    ```
2.  Create a folder for Tailer SDK and access it:

    ```bash
    mkdir tailer
    cd tailer
    ```

{% hint style="success" %}
Your Windows environment is now ready. You can proceed with the [installation](install-tailer-sdk.md).
{% endhint %}

## :green\_apple: macOS/Linux

### **Set Bash as default shell**

To change the default shell to Bash:

1.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    chsh -s /bin/bash
    ```
2. Close your terminal and reopen it.
3.  Run the following command to make sure the default shell is now bash:

    ```bash
    env
    ```

{% hint style="success" %}
If you get the following result, Bash has been installed successfully:

```
SHELL=/bin/bash
```
{% endhint %}

### **Create a working folder**

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend that you create the Tailer SDK working folder in your home root directory.
{% endhint %}

To create and access the working folder, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir ~/tailer
cd ~/tailer
```

Examples in this documentation will assume that you're working in the **tailer** folder created at this step.

### **Upgrade Python**

While current versions of macOS and Linux include a version of Python 2, Tailer SDK only supports Python 3.7 or higher, so you need to upgrade to a newer version.

#### **Install Homebrew**

To install Python, you first need to install Homebrew, a package management system that simplifies software installation:

1.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
2.  Make sure the installation was successful by running the following command:

    ```bash
    brew doctor
    ```

{% hint style="success" %}
Now that Homebrew is installed, you can upgrade to Python 3.
{% endhint %}

#### **Upgrade to Python 3**

To upgrade Python:

1.  Check your current version of Python by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
2.  If your version is inferior to 3.7, install the latest version of Python 3 by running the following command:

    ```bash
    brew install python3
    ```
3.  To confirm which version of Python 3 was installed, run the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

{% hint style="success" %}
Your macOS/Linux environment is now ready. You can proceed with the [installation](install-tailer-sdk.md).
{% endhint %}
